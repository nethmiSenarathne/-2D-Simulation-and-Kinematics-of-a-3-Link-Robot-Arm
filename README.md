# -2D-Simulation-and-Kinematics-of-a-3-Link-Robot-Arm

Iâ€™ve been working on forward and inverse kinematics, simulating the movements of a 3-link robot arm, and implementing path planning algorithms for obstacle avoidance. This project includes a 2D simulation that visualizes the arm's movements, providing valuable insights into the practical aspects of robotics and automation.
